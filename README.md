Prediction of Housing Affordability Based on Wage Growth and Inflation in the EU

Overview

This project aims to predict housing affordability trends across EU countries by analyzing the impact of wage growth, inflation, and housing costs. Using statistical and machine learning techniques, the project uncovers patterns and proposes evidence-based solutions for improving housing accessibility.

Problem Statement

Housing affordability has become a critical issue in the EU, where rising housing costs and inflation often outpace wage growth. This project models the interplay of these factors to identify affordability trends and recommend strategies for mitigating the impact of economic pressures on housing.

Dataset Sources

The project integrates data from multiple sources to ensure a comprehensive analysis:

1. Eurostat:

Wage growth, inflation rates, GDP per capita, and household disposable income:

Eurostat Wage Growth & Inflation

Eurostat Household Income

2. Global Property Guide:

Average property prices, regional housing trends, and affordability indices:

Global Property Guide

Eurostat Housing Affordability

Research Questions

Primary Research Question:

How do wage growth and inflation rates correlate with housing affordability trends across the EU?

Secondary Research Questions:

Can predictive models accurately forecast housing affordability trends for specific regions in the EU?

How do housing affordability disparities differ between urban and rural areas in the EU, and which regions are most vulnerable to affordability crises?

Project Workflow

1. Design Overview

Data Engineering: Extracting, cleaning, and transforming data from multiple sources.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends, identifying key drivers, and visualizing disparities.

Machine Learning (ML) Models: Building predictive models for housing affordability.

2. Data Engineering and Ethical Issues

Data Engineering Challenges:

Standardizing datasets from different sources and formats.

Handling missing data for housing prices or regional wage data.

Addressing temporal mismatches in datasets (e.g., inflation data vs. property price data).

Ethical Considerations:

Ensuring privacy by anonymizing demographic data if required.

Avoiding biases in predictive models, particularly regarding regional disparities.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze the distribution of wage growth, inflation, and housing prices across time.

Explore correlations between economic indicators and housing affordability.

Compare urban vs. rural affordability trends and visualize disparities across countries.

4. Predictive Modeling

Implement regression-based models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict affordability indices.

Test alternative methods, such as XGBoost or Neural Networks, for robust prediction.

Evaluate model accuracy using metrics such as RMSE, R^2, and MAE.

Expected Deliverables

Datasets: Cleaned and integrated data for analysis, combining Eurostat and external sources.

EDA Results: Visualizations and insights highlighting housing affordability trends and disparities.

ML Models: Predictive models with documented performance metrics.
